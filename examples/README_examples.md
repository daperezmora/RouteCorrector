# Examples for RouteCorrector

This folder contains example datasets and a QGIS project to demonstrate the workflow of the **RouteCorrector** plugin.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `gps_points.geojson` | Original GPS-based measurements (raw points before correction). |
| `reference_route.geojson` | Reference route manually drawn along the intended path (used as correction base). |
| `points_corrected.geojson` | Output generated by the RouteCorrector plugin after applying distance-based correction. |
| `example_project.qgz` | A QGIS project file that loads all layers (points, route, and corrected data) with a base map for visualization. |

---

## How to use

1. Open **`example_project.qgz`** in QGIS (version ≥ 3.22).
2. Ensure that all `.geojson` layers appear correctly in the map view.  
   *(If they show as missing, use “Set Data Source” and point to the files in this folder.)*
3. You will see:
   - Orange points → `gps_points.geojson` (raw data)  
   - Blue line → `reference_route.geojson` (reference path)  
   - Yellow points → `points_corrected.geojson` (corrected positions)
4. The corrected layer was produced using the **Distance-based correction mode**, which preserves original distances between measurements while aligning them with the route.

## Purpose

These example files are provided to illustrate the core functionality of the RouteCorrector plugin:
- Definition of reference routes,
- Selection of correction anchors,
- Execution of motion- or distance-based corrections, and
- Export of spatially aligned datasets for further analysis.
